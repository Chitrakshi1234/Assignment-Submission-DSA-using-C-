Question 1 :
	What is the time complexity T(n) for the following code snippet?
	a = 1
	b = 1
	while(b <= n)
	{
	 a += 1;
	 b += 1;
	 cout<<"Hi";
	}

Answer: T(n) = O(n) , i.e Linear Time Complexity


Question 2 : 
	Write the output for the following recursive code snippet for n = 3:
	void fun(int n)
	{
	if(n > 0)
	{
	cout<<n;
	fun(n - 1);
	cout<<n;
	}
	}

Answer: for n=5
